    cats a very cute and very likeable and i know some of you chose dogs over cats but heres my persective 
     cats can grow to be very big and they do not eat cat food as soon as they are born they will drink hot milk but not normal 
     milk beacuse some cats could get sick from normal milk.when i first got my cat she liked to sleep alot but that was probably 
    beacuse she was very little. cats ages go by 1 month 2 month and so on till 12 months a 1 month old kitten is like a 3 month old babby a 3 month 
     old kitten is a 4 year old childe. i find dogs very loud and nosiy when they bark but cats mewos are very cute to me andf they are very calm animals.
